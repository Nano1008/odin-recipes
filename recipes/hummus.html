    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Hummus is a delicious spread (or dip) made from chickpeas, tahini, lemon, and spices. It is a popular dish in the Middle East and the Mediterranean. You can find it in most grocery stores, but trust me, youâ€™ll want to skip those and make your own. Homemade hummus is just so much better!</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Chickpeas (or garbanzo beans)</li>
        <li>Tahini</li>
        <li>Lemon juice</li>
        <li>Garlic</li>
        <li>Ground cumin and salt</li>
        <li>Olive oil</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Tahini and lemon juice go in first.</li>
        <li>Turn on the food processor and let it run for a minute or two.</li>
        <li>Now, we can add the remaining hummus ingredients.</li>
        <li>When it looks close to done, add a splash of cold water while the processor is still running. After a few tablespoons of water, the mixture transforms into fluffy, creamy, whipped hummus.</li>
    </ol>
